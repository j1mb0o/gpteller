While exploring, he uncovers a hidden map, igniting a quest to find rumored treasures in a secret cove. Emboldened, Dash races forward, overcoming obstacles: leaping over a crab blockade and skillfully slipping across a slick log bridge amidst rising tides. Reaching the cove, he encounters Finn, a clever dolphin guarding the treasure. Finn poses a riddle, "What runs but never walks, has a mouth but never talks?" Dash triumphantly answers, "A river!" Impressed, Finn reveals a chest brimming with sparkling seashells and stones. Victorious, Dash returns home, the sunset casting long shadows behind him. His heart swells with joy as the waves and wind celebrate his daring feats, leaving a trail of paw prints and a newfound tale of courage, balance, and wit at Crestview Beach.
